Tonight we shipped a few Discord + automation improvements:

• **Staff reference channels** — pinned channel ID list and cron/automation inventory for dev/staff lookup
• **Monthly Activity Dividend** — #economy-guide now gets a monthly Grok report with exact per-player Gold payouts (wallet credits still queue in-game as before)
• **Test dividend preview** posted to economy — no payouts issued, format check only

Daily/weekly briefs, town plot counts, and wallet vs net worth reporting from earlier this week are live on the Worker — deploy + plugin sync if anything still looks stale in-game.

Questions → staff or #economy-guide for treasury/dividend stuff.`;
