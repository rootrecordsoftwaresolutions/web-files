# Root Goals — product concept

**Status:** Root Goals **1.0.0 · Release 0** (foundation)  
**Implementation:** `Web/apps/root-goals-web/` · `Web/cloudflare/rootrecord-api-goals/` · `Mobile/root-goals-mobile/`  
**Public share URLs:** `https://rootrecord.info/{custodialSolanaAddress}/goals` and `https://goals.rootrecord.info/{address}/goals/{goal-slug}`  
**Audience:** Engineering, design, operators  
**Last updated:** 2026-06-03  

Root Goals helps people define outcomes, break them into trackable steps, and get an AI-generated plan from their own inputs. Onboarding is **guest-first** (no account until the wizard finishes), then **sign up / sign in**, then **Grok** builds a detailed plan while the UI shows **Generating Goal Plan**.
