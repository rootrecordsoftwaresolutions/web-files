## Full post

**Root Goals 1.0.0 — Release 0**  
*A new app by Root Record*

We’re shipping the **foundation** for **Root Goals** — a place to define outcomes, break them into trackable steps, and get an AI-generated plan from *your* inputs.

---

### What Release 0 is

**Release 0** is the first versioned cut (`1.0.0`). It establishes onboarding, guest-first drafts, Grok plan generation, **Actions** and **Suggestions**, public-share scaffolding, and the core data model. It is the base we bump from (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`, etc.) as we ship more — not the finished product yet.

---

### What it does

You describe a goal in your own words — name, category, purpose, optional cost, detailed steps, and a timeline. **You can do all of that before creating an account.** Your draft is saved on the server via a guest device id so it survives refresh.

When you sign up or sign in, the app runs **Generating Goal Plan** while Grok builds a detailed plan from everything you entered. You see your inputs plus the AI summary, concrete **Actions**, and optional **Suggestions**.

Track progress with achievements and notes/costs/income entries. Refresh the AI plan within tier limits (free: 3 goals, 1 refresh per goal every 3 days; members: 42 goals, more refreshes).

Share goals publicly using your custodial Solana address — visible at both `rootrecord.info/{address}/goals` and `goals.rootrecord.info/{address}/goals`.

### Actions & Suggestions

| | |
|---|---|
| **Actions** | Grok-generated next steps tied to your goal. Delete any you don’t want. |
| **Suggestions** | Grok-generated ideas and alternatives. Delete any you don’t want. |

Both are **always labeled AI-generated**. They are not Root Record editorial content.

5. Money (optional cost)  
6. Steps (detailed summary)  
7. Timeline (min/max days → estimated completion)

## Smoke test checklist (operators)

- [ ] Guest completes onboarding steps 1–8; refresh browser — draft restored  
- [ ] **I already did this** → auth → home (no broken finalize)  
- [ ] Sign up → **Generating Goal Plan** → goal created with Actions + Suggestions  
- [ ] Delete an Action and a Suggestion; AI refresh does not re-propose deleted ids  
- [ ] Disclaimer visible on auth gate, goal detail, Actions/Suggestions sections  
- [ ] Toggle public share; both canonical and mirror URLs load  
- [ ] `GET /api/mobile/config` returns `version: "1.0.0"`, `release: 0`  
- [ ] Android debug APK loads app and hits `api-goals.rootrecord.info`  
- [ ] Deploy: `cloudflare-update-workers.bat goals`, `cloudflare-update-pages.bat goals`, marketing site deploy
